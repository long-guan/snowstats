# snowstats

### Features

### Challenges

- 10/26/23: To toggle on and off the tooltip (popup) to display each runs name, a booleans has to be set. Instead of creating a bunch of useState boolean variables for each area, I'm going to store all the boolean variables in an array and associate corresponding index of the array to the area.name

### Future Additions

- Make the app responsive and usable on a mobile device
- Add a location to add reviews on the road conditions
- Add a location to add reviews on the general snow conditions
- Allow users without accounts to comment on road conditions or general snow conditions
